A reverse motion sensor was developed using an STM32 microcontroller and an ultrasonic distance sensor (PWM + IC) to indicate the distance of a vehicle from an obstacle through an RGB LED (PWM) with a color scale of at least four colors â€“ Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red. The distance was displayed on a panel built with STM32CubeMonitor. The ultrasonic sensor used was the HR04 module.
